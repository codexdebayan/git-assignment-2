# Readme for a python project

Numpy is a Python library and is the fundamental package for N-dimensional arrays, numerical computing tools, and interoperability with other libraries

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy.

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform basic arithmetic operations
array_plus_10 = array + 10
array_times_2 = array * 2

# Calculate basic statistics
array_mean = np.mean(array)
array_sum = np.sum(array)
array_std_dev = np.std(array)

# Create a 2D array (matrix)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Perform matrix operations
matrix_transpose = np.transpose(matrix)
matrix_dot_product = np.dot(matrix, matrix_transpose)

# Print results
print("Original Array:", array)
print("Array Plus 10:", array_plus_10)
print("Array Times 2:", array_times_2)
print("Mean of Array:", array_mean)
print("Sum of Array:", array_sum)
print("Standard Deviation of Array:", array_std_dev)

print("\nOriginal Matrix:\n", matrix)
print("Transposed Matrix:\n", matrix_transpose)
print("Dot Product of Matrix with its Transpose:\n", matrix_dot_product)
```
